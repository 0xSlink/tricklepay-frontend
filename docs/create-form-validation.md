# Create-stream form validation

The client rejects bad input before it ever builds a transaction, so anything you
send to the network has already passed the rules below. This is the full list,
field by field, with the exact message you see for each failure.

## 1. Where the rules live

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `lib/create-stream-validation.ts` | The per-field rules and the required-field messages for this form, plus `validateCreateStreamForm`, which composes them. |
| `lib/validation.ts` | The underlying checks: `isValidStellarAddress`, `isValidContractAddress`, `parseAmount`, and `toUnix`. Shared with the rest of the app. |
| `hooks/use-create-stream-form.ts` | Calls the rules as you type, and re-runs the whole set on submit. |
| `components/create-stream-fields.tsx` | Renders each message under its input, with `aria-invalid` on the field. |

The rules are pure functions returning a message or `undefined`, which is why
they can be unit tested without React (`lib/create-stream-validation.test.ts`).

---

## 2. When a rule runs

**Live, as you type.** `recipient`, `token`, and `amount` are checked on every
change. `end` and `cliff` are re-checked whenever `start` or `end` moves, since
both are judged relative to the window.

**On submit.** Pressing "Review stream" re-runs the complete set through
`validateCreateStreamForm`, so a stale live message can never disagree with what
is accepted. If anything fails, nothing is sent to the wallet: the first invalid
field in screen order — `recipient`, `token`, `amount`, `start`, `end`, `cliff` —
is focused and the review step does not open.

**The empty-field exception.** Clearing `recipient`, `token`, or `amount` does
*not* raise a "required" message while you are still typing — the field simply
goes quiet until you fill it or submit. The two date fields are the exception:
emptying `start` or `end` shows its required message immediately, because an
empty date input is unambiguous.

**One rule is also a button gate.** "Review stream" stays disabled until both
addresses are present and well-formed (`addressesValid` in the hook), and while a
network mismatch is present. A malformed recipient or token therefore shows its
message under the field with the button disabled, rather than being reported on
submit; the `Recipient address is required.` and `Token contract id is required.`
strings are the submit-time safety net for that path.

## 3. The rules

Every message below is the literal string the form renders.

### Recipient address

| Rule | Message |
|---|---|
| Must not be empty (submit) | `Recipient address is required.` |
| Must be a Stellar public key (`G...`) or a contract address (`C...`) | `Must be a valid G... or C... Stellar address.` |

The check is the SDK's own `StrKey` validation, so a `G...` address with a broken
checksum is rejected as well.

### Token contract id

| Rule | Message |
|---|---|
| Must not be empty (submit) | `Token contract id is required.` |
| Must be a contract address (`C...`) | `Must be a valid C... contract address.` |

Stricter than the recipient field on purpose: a token is always a contract, so a
`G...` account address is rejected here even though it would pass as a recipient.

### Amount

| Rule | Message | Example that triggers it |
|---|---|---|
| Must not be empty (submit) | `Amount is required.` | `""` |
| Must be a plain non-negative decimal | `Amount must be a positive number (e.g. 100 or 1.5).` | `abc`, `-3`, `+5`, `1e5`, `1.2.3` |
| At most 7 decimal places | `Amount cannot have more than 7 decimal places.` | `100.12345678` |
| Must be greater than zero | `Amount must be greater than zero.` | `0`, `0.0000000` |

Details:

- Surrounding whitespace is trimmed, so `"  5  "` is accepted. A value that is
  *only* whitespace trims to empty and reports `Amount is required.`
- `1e5` and `1.2.3` are rejected rather than coerced; the rule is a single
  `^\d+(\.\d+)?$` match.
- More than 7 decimals is an error, not a silent rounding — the field's own hint
  says "Up to 7 decimal places (e.g. 1.0000001)".
- The value stays a string until submit; the conversion to 7-decimal base units
  (the Stellar stroop standard) happens once, in `parseAmount`.

### Start

| Rule | Message |
|---|---|
| Must not be empty | `Start date is required.` |

Shown as soon as the field is cleared. The value comes from a `datetime-local`
input in **your** local timezone, and the field shows its UTC equivalent
underneath so you can check it against the stream you intend.

### End

| Rule | Message |
|---|---|
| Must not be empty | `End date is required.` |
| Must be strictly after start | `End must be after start.` |

An end equal to the start is rejected too — a zero-length stream would vest
nothing.

### Cliff (optional)

| Rule | Message |
|---|---|
| If present, must fall between start and end | `Cliff must fall between start and end.` |

- **Optional.** Leaving it blank is valid, and the contract then receives
  `cliffTime = startTime`, so vesting starts immediately.
- **Inclusive bounds.** A cliff exactly equal to start or end is accepted; only a
  value strictly outside the window is rejected.
- **Skipped until the window exists.** With `start` or `end` still empty the
  cliff is not judged, because there is nothing to compare it against.
- It is re-checked when `start` or `end` changes, so narrowing the window can
  turn a previously valid cliff into an error.

## 4. What happens once the form is valid

Validation passing does **not** send anything. It moves the form to the review
step (`components/stream-review.tsx`), where the exact parameters that will go
on-chain are shown — amount converted to 7-decimal base units, dates converted to
Unix seconds, a blank cliff defaulted to the start time. Only "Create stream" on
that step builds, signs, and submits the transaction.

---

## 5. What this list does not cover

- **Contract-side rules.** Once submitted, the contract enforces its own
  conditions (already cancelled, nothing to withdraw yet, insufficient balance).
  Those messages come from `lib/contract-errors.ts` and are listed in
  [api-contract.md](api-contract.md#3-error-contract).
- **The network guard.** A wrong-network wallet is refused before any field is
  looked at, with `Wrong network: wallet is on <network>, app expects <network>.
  Switch networks in Freighter.` (see [use-network-guard.ts](../hooks/use-network-guard.ts)).
- **The withdraw form's amount rules**, which are a separate set with their own
  messages (`Enter an amount.`, `Amount cannot be negative.`, `Amount exceeds
  withdrawable balance (…)`) in `lib/amount.ts`.
- **Unparseable date strings.** `lib/validation.ts` also contains
  `validateStreamDates` and an `Invalid date input.` error, but they are not
  wired into this form: a `datetime-local` input only ever yields an empty or
  well-formed value, so the form's date rules compare timestamps directly.
